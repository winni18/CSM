{"step": 71, "state": "[CLS]  read of unseen terror [SEP]  This legend, written in an ancient tongue, goes something like this: At one time a shapeless and formless manifestation of evil was disturbed from millenia of sleep. It was so powerful that it required the combined wisdom of the leading enchanters of that age to conquer it. The legend tells how the enchanters lured the Terror \"to a recess deep within the earth\" by placing there a powerful spell scroll. When it had reached the scroll, the enchanters trapped it there with a spell that encased it in the living rock. The Terror was so horrible that none would dare speak of it. A comment at the end of the narration indicates that the story is considered to be quite fanciful; no other chronicles of the age mention the Terror in any form.  you are carrying:   a dusty book   a frayed scroll   a beautiful, ornamented egg   a battered lantern (providing light)", "state_tokens": [50257, 1100, 286, 29587, 3246, 50258, 770, 8177, 11, 3194, 287, 281, 6156, 11880, 11, 2925, 1223, 588, 428, 25, 1629, 530, 640, 257, 427, 499, 5321, 290, 1296, 1203, 30566, 286, 6181, 373, 24069, 422, 3939, 268, 544, 286, 3993, 13, 632, 373, 523, 3665, 326, 340, 2672, 262, 5929, 11501, 286, 262, 3756, 551, 3147, 1010, 286, 326, 2479, 284, 23875, 340, 13, 383, 8177, 4952, 703, 262, 551, 3147, 1010, 41546, 262, 14915, 366, 1462, 257, 28836, 2769, 1626, 262, 4534, 1, 416, 12560, 612, 257, 3665, 4822, 10743, 13, 1649, 340, 550, 4251, 262, 10743, 11, 262, 551, 3147, 1010, 13640, 340, 612, 351, 257, 4822, 326, 2207, 839, 340, 287, 262, 2877, 3881, 13, 383, 14915, 373, 523, 12361, 326, 4844, 561, 16498, 2740, 286, 340, 13, 317, 2912, 379, 262, 886, 286, 262, 45127, 9217, 326, 262, 1621, 318, 3177, 284, 307, 2407, 39980, 4135, 26, 645, 584, 16199, 2983, 286, 262, 2479, 3068, 262, 14915, 287, 597, 1296, 13, 220, 345, 389, 6872, 25, 220, 220, 257, 36972, 1492, 220, 220, 257, 1216, 16548, 10743, 220, 220, 257, 4950, 11, 45618, 276, 5935, 220, 220, 257, 33613, 41207, 357, 15234, 2530, 1657, 8], "action": "drop dusty book", "action_tokens": [4268, 36972, 1492], "valid_action": ["blorb bread", "blorb dusty book", "blorb egg", "blorb jug", "blorb lantern", "blorb scroll", "blorb water", "break knob", "break knob with crank", "close button", "close crank", "close dusty book", "close egg", "close gate", "close knob", "close slide", "drop all but candle", "east", "enter gate", "gnusto gondar ", "look around dusty book", "look at all with dusty book", "look at dusty book with egg", "look at knob with spell", "look knob", "look spell", "north", "open area with knob", "open bread with knob", "open button with dusty book", "open castle with knob", "open cleesh  with knob", "open crank with dusty book", "open egg with dusty book", "open forest with knob", "open gate with dusty book", "open gondar  with knob", "open jug with dusty book", "open knob with dusty book", "open lantern with knob", "open nitfol  with knob", "open passage with knob", "open rezrov  with knob", "open scroll with knob", "open slide with dusty book", "open tower with knob", "open water with knob", "open zifmia  with knob", "pour jug from knob", "put down all", "put down bread", "put down button", "put down crank", "put down dusty book", "put down egg", "put down jug", "put down knob", "put down lantern", "put down scroll", "put down slide", "south", "throw bread at knob", "throw button at knob", "throw cleesh  at knob", "throw crank at knob", "throw dusty book at knob", "throw egg at knob", "throw knob at crank", "throw lantern at knob", "throw nitfol  at knob", "throw rezrov  at knob", "throw scroll at knob", "throw slide at knob", "throw zifmia  at knob", "turn off lantern", "west"]}
